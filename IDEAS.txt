# IDEAS FOR GCS FITTING TOOL

This is the file where we can put ideas for future improvments and tweaks that would make the program work better and be more useful for all of us. I tried to divide it into a few sections. Give suggestions, put questions, note things that are missing or that are not needed.

## PLOTTING

The fitting can actually be done with other coronagraphs other than C3 C2, STA and STB. What happens if we have another POV?
The plotting should have 2 images for each spacecraft, some Delta(t) apart. with that and a second height slider the speed and time of insertion at 21.5 Rs should be easily calculated which would save time and confusion about how to do it.


## IMAGE SELECTION

The other program in the git is a trial for making a more adequate selection of images, and checking what are the available ones. It would be nice if it is interactive a bit and play around with the available images for then doing the plotting (like when you try to do a StereoCAT fit)

## CODE OPTIMIZATION
the geometry file has a lot of extra stuff that I added and might not be necessary.
